      "In the bustling city of Busan, where the sea breeze mingles with the scent of grilled octopus, a small, neon‑lit alley called *Myeongjang* comes alive every Thursday night. It’s a place where street vendors, musicians, and curious travelers converge, weaving a tapestry of sounds, flavors, and unexpected friendships.\n",

      "|-----------|------|---------------------|\n",
      "| **Ji‑woo** | A shy university student who loves sketching | She carries a battered sketchbook and dreams of turning her doodles into a comic series. |\n",
      "| **Mr. Park** | The owner of a 30‑year‑old dumpling stall | He’s known for his *samgyeopsal* (pork belly) dumplings, which he says “hold the taste of a whole village.” |\n",
      "| **Luna** | A street musician with a violin | Her music can make even the most hardened commuters pause and smile. |\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **First Encounter**  \n",
      "   Ji‑woo, late for a study group, darts into Myeongjang to grab a quick bite. She spots Mr. Park’s stall and, drawn by the aroma, buys a dumpling. While waiting, she pulls out her sketchbook and starts drawing the bustling crowd. Luna, passing by, hears the soft scratching of charcoal and stops to watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **A Shared Moment**  \n",
      "   Luna, sensing Ji‑woo’s nervous energy, begins to play a gentle melody. The tune syncs perfectly with the rhythm of the market’s chatter. Ji‑woo’s sketch transforms from a hurried scribble to a vivid scene: a violinist under a golden lantern, a vendor serving steaming dumplings, and a lone student watching the night unfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Lantern’s Glow**  \n",
      "   As the music swells, an ancient golden lantern, usually hanging above the main entrance, flickers to life despite the rain. Its light spills onto the cobblestones, bathing the alley in warm amber. The crowd murmurs, “It’s the Lantern Festival—once a year, wishes are said to come true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **A Wish Unfolds**  \n",
      "   Mr. Park, with a grin, leans over to Ji‑woo and whispers, “If you wish, tell the lantern your dream.” Ji‑woo hesitates, then whispers, “I wish my sketches could be seen by more people, so I can share the stories of this place.” Luna adds, “May your music and art reach every heart that passes through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "   The lantern’s glow brightens for a heartbeat, then settles. The night feels charged, as if the wish had been heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The Afterglow**  \n",
      "   The following week, Ji‑woo posts a photo of her sketch on a local social platform. Within hours, it goes viral, featuring the golden lantern and Luna’s violin. The post catches the eye of a small publishing house, which invites Ji‑woo to create a comic series about Myeongjang’s hidden stories. Luna’s music, recorded from that night, becomes the soundtrack for the project’s promotional video.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Meanwhile, Mr. Park’s dumplings sell out every Thursday, and the golden lantern is restored to its permanent place, now a symbol of community hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Moral\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in a city that never sleeps, a single moment of genuine connection—between a student, a vendor, and a musician—can illuminate a path that leads to unexpected opportunities. The golden lantern didn’t grant a miracle; it reflected the wishes already present in the hearts of those who dared to share a smile, a song, and a sketch.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Enjoy the night markets of your own city, and who knows—perhaps you’ll stumble upon your own lantern, waiting to catch the glow of your dreams.** 🌟"
